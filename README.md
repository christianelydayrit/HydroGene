# HydroGene
This project is a power generator that harnesses energy from rain, utilizing Arduino and a GSM module for monitoring and notifications. It was our capstone project, earning us 3rd place in the Research Exhibit 2023 at Our Lady of Fatima University (OLFU).

Features:

-Rain Energy Harnessing
The system captures and converts rain energy into usable power.
The generated power is stored in a 3-lithium battery pack, each consisting of six 18650 batteries, providing a total capacity of 13,200mAh.

-Real-Time Monitoring with Arduino
Tracks whether the turbine is spinning and actively generating power.
Monitors the charge percentage of each battery pack.

-GSM Module for Notifications
Automatically notifies users about system updates and battery statuses.
Sends alerts when:
    A battery pack is fully charged.
    The system detects changes in turbine activity.
Allows users to check the percentage of each battery pack remotely.

-Highlights
Award-Winning Innovation: Achieved 3rd place at the Research Exhibit 2023 for its unique and practical design.
Sustainable Energy Solution: Provides a green energy source by leveraging rain as a renewable power generator.
User-Friendly Alerts: Ensures users stay informed about system performance and battery health.
